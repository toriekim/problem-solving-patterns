// Write a function called `isSubsequence` which takes in two striings and checks whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string. In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing.

const isSubsequence = (str1, str2) => {
  // Your code here

}

// Examples:
isSubsequence('hello', 'hello world') // true
isSubsequence('sing', 'sting') // true
isSubsequence('abc', 'abracadabra') // true
isSubsequence('abc', 'acb') // false
